# Billing Corrections Time Restriction Feature

## Overview
This feature implements time-based restrictions for manager billing corrections, allowing corrections only during the first 5 days of each month for the previous month's records.

## Feature Details

### Business Rules
- **Current Month**: Always editable for the entire month
- **Previous Month**: Only editable until the 5th of the current month
- **Older Records**: Not editable (only current and previous month when allowed)
- **Time Window**: Managers have 1 month + 5 days to correct any given month's records

### Implementation

#### 1. Backend Validation Functions
**File**: `backend/utils/helpers.py`

- `can_edit_billing_corrections()`: Checks if billing corrections are currently allowed
- `validate_billing_correction_date(date_str)`: Validates specific correction dates

#### 2. Route Updates
**Files**: 
- `app.py` (lines 496-618)
- `backend/routes/manager_routes.py` (lines 361-477)

Both route handlers now include:
- Date restriction validation before processing requests
- Clear error messages when corrections are blocked
- Context data passed to templates for UI control

#### 3. Frontend Integration
**File**: `templates/manager_billing_corrections.html`

- **Alert System**: Shows current restriction status
- **Form Control**: Disables form when corrections are not allowed
- **Date Validation**: Client-side restrictions on date picker
- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging about when corrections will be available

#### 4. Configuration
**File**: `backend/config.py` (newly created)

Added missing configuration module to resolve import errors.

### User Experience

#### During Early Month Period (1st-5th of month)
- ✅ Blue info alert: "You can make billing corrections for [Previous Month] and [Current Month] until [Month 5th] (previous month deadline)"
- ✅ Form is fully functional
- ✅ Date picker shows both current and previous month dates
- ✅ Can correct both months

#### During Later Month Period (6th onwards)
- ✅ Blue info alert: "You can make billing corrections for [Current Month] only. Previous month corrections were available until [Month 5th]"
- ✅ Form is fully functional
- ✅ Date picker shows only current month dates
- ✅ Can correct current month only

## Example Scenarios

| Current Date | Can Correct Current Month | Can Correct Previous Month | Allowed Dates |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Sept 3rd | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Aug) | Aug 1-31, Sept 1-3 |
| Sept 5th | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Aug, last day) | Aug 1-31, Sept 1-5 |
| Sept 6th | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Sept 1-6 only |
| Sept 18th | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Sept 1-18 only |
| Oct 1st | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Sept) | Sept 1-30, Oct 1 |

## Technical Features

### Server-Side Protection
- Route-level validation prevents bypassing restrictions
- Clear error messages returned for blocked requests
- Audit logging continues to work normally

### Client-Side Enhancement
- JavaScript date validation prevents invalid selections
- Form submission blocked for invalid date ranges
- Real-time feedback on date selection

### Data Integrity
- Previous billing correction records remain unchanged
- Audit trail is preserved
- No impact on existing correction history

## Error Messages

### During Blocked Period
```
"Billing corrections are only allowed until the 5th of each month. 
You can next make corrections starting from [Next Month 1st]."
```

### Invalid Date Selection
```
"You can only correct dates from [Previous Month] onwards."
"You can only correct dates up to [Last Day of Previous Month] (last month)."
"You cannot correct future dates."
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various date scenarios:
- ✅ 3rd of month: Allows corrections
- ✅ 5th of month: Allows corrections (boundary case)
- ✅ 6th of month: Blocks corrections
- ✅ 15th of month: Blocks corrections
- ✅ Date validation works correctly for specific dates

## Files Modified

1. `backend/utils/helpers.py` - Added validation functions
2. `app.py` - Updated billing corrections route (lines 496-618)
3. `backend/routes/manager_routes.py` - Updated billing corrections route (lines 361-477)
4. `templates/manager_billing_corrections.html` - Enhanced UI with restrictions
5. `backend/config.py` - Created missing configuration module

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Uses existing Flask, datetime, and JavaScript functionality.
