# Vendor Timesheet Tool - Demo Script
**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Participants:** Interviewer (I) + Presenter (P)

---

## **Opening (30 seconds)**

**I:** "Hi! Today we're looking at a solution for vendor timesheet management. Can you tell us what problem this tool solves?"

**P:** "Absolutely! Managing vendor attendance is a nightmare - manual timesheets, missing entries, billing disputes, and hours spent reconciling swipe data. Our Vendor Timesheet Tool automates this entire process with real-time tracking, automated reminders, and seamless reconciliation."

---

## **System Overview (45 seconds)**

**I:** "Interesting! Who uses this system and how does it work?"

**P:** *(Screen: Login page)* "Great question! We have three types of users with role-based access:"

*(Demonstrating login)*
- "**Vendors** - submit daily status"
- "**Managers** - approve team timesheets" 
- "**Admins** - configure system and generate reports"

*(Screen: Dashboard overview)*
"The beauty is that everyone sees exactly what they need - no more, no less. Security and simplicity combined."

## **Vendor Workflow Demo (60 seconds)**

**I:** "How does a typical vendor use this day-to-day?"

**P:** *(Screen: Vendor dashboard)* "Let me show you! As a vendor, John logs in every morning and sees his simple dashboard."

*(Demonstrating)*
- "**Daily status submission** - just a few clicks: In Office, Work From Home, On Leave, or Half Day"
- "**Location specification** - Office or Home"
- *(Screen: Submission confirmation)* "Status submitted! That's it."

*(Screen: Reminder notification)*
"But what if John forgets? The system automatically sends Teams reminders every 3 hours until he fills it. No more chasing people!"

**I:** "That's convenient! What about tracking history?"

**P:** *(Screen: Vendor history)* "John can view his complete attendance history, see any late entries, and track his monthly summary. Full transparency!"

## **Manager Workflow Demo (75 seconds)**

**I:** "How do managers stay on top of their teams?"

**P:** *(Screen: Manager dashboard)* "Managers get a real-time team overview. Let me show you Sarah, a team manager."

*(Demonstrating)*
- *(Screen: Team status grid)* "**Live team status** - she sees who's in office, working from home, or on leave"
- "**Smart notifications** - automatic alerts at 12 PM, 2 PM, and when everyone's submitted"

**I:** "What about approvals?"

**P:** *(Screen: Approval interface)* "Perfect question! Sarah can approve or reject any entry with comments."

*(Demonstrating approval process)*
- "**Bulk approvals** for accurate entries"
- "**Individual review** for questionable ones"
- "**Instant feedback** to vendors"

*(Screen: Team reports)*
"Plus monthly team reports for billing and performance tracking."

## **Smart Reconciliation Demo (60 seconds)**

**I:** "How does it handle discrepancies with actual attendance data?"

**P:** *(Screen: Reconciliation dashboard)* "This is where the magic happens! Every month, we import attendance swipe data automatically."

*(Demonstrating)*
- *(Screen: Data import)* "**Automated import** from swipe machines"
- *(Screen: Mismatch detection)* "**Smart comparison** - the system flags discrepancies instantly"

*(Screen: Mismatch workflow)*
"When there's a mismatch - say John claimed 'In Office' but didn't swipe:"
- "**Vendor explanation** - John explains (forgot to swipe)"
- "**Manager review** - Sarah approves the explanation"
- "**Audit trail** - everything is documented"

**I:** "What about billing accuracy?"

**P:** *(Screen: Billing reports)* "**Automated corrections** - any adjustments flow into next month's billing. No manual calculations, no disputes!"

---

## **Admin Features & Automation (45 seconds)**

**I:** "How easy is it to manage the system?"

**P:** *(Screen: Admin dashboard)* "Super simple! Admins handle configuration once:"

*(Demonstrating quickly)*
- "**Vendor master data** - bulk upload or individual setup"
- "**Holiday calendar** - automatic marking of non-working days"
- "**Company policies** - half-day rules, working hours, etc."

*(Screen: Automated features)*
"The system handles the rest automatically - weekends marked, holidays applied, and offset corrections for billing."

---

## **Reports & Value Proposition (30 seconds)**

**I:** "What kind of insights does this provide?"

**P:** *(Screen: Reports dashboard)* "Comprehensive reporting with real business impact:"

*(Quick demonstration)*
