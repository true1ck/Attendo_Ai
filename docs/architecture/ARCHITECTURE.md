# ATTENDO - System Architecture

## Overview

ATTENDO follows a modern enterprise architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, modular design, and scalable deployment options.

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- **Modular Design**: Component-based architecture with loosely coupled modules
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configurations for different deployment scenarios
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growth in users, data, and functionality
- **Maintainability**: Code organization that enables easy maintenance and feature additions

## System Components

### Core Application Layer (`src/attendo/`)

```
src/attendo/
├── core/              # Application factory and core initialization
├── models/            # Database models and schema definitions
├── api/              # REST API endpoints and blueprints
├── services/         # Business logic services
├── utils/            # Utility functions and helpers
├── config/           # Configuration management
├── middleware/       # Custom middleware components
└── web/              # Web templates and static assets
```

### API Layer Architecture

The API layer is organized into focused blueprints:

- **Auth Blueprint** (`api/auth.py`): Authentication and authorization
- **Vendor Blueprint** (`api/vendor.py`): Vendor-specific endpoints
- **Manager Blueprint** (`api/manager.py`): Manager dashboard and team management
- **Admin Blueprint** (`api/admin.py`): Administrative functions
- **Reports Blueprint** (`api/reports.py`): Report generation and exports
- **Charts Blueprint** (`api/charts.py`): Analytics and visualization data

### Service Layer

Business logic is encapsulated in service classes:

- **NotificationService**: Handles automated notifications and reminders
- **ReportService**: Generates various reports and exports
- **AuditService**: Manages system audit trails
- **AIService**: Provides predictive analytics and insights
- **ImportService**: Handles data imports from external systems

### Data Layer

The data layer uses SQLAlchemy ORM with well-defined models:

- **User Models**: User authentication and profiles
- **Attendance Models**: Daily status tracking and approvals
- **Reporting Models**: Audit logs, notifications, and system configuration
- **Integration Models**: Swipe records, leave data, and external system imports

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

- Local SQLite database
- Flask development server
- Debug mode enabled
- Hot reloading for templates

### Production Environment

- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Gunicorn WSGI server
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration (optional)

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all system actions
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based secret management

## Monitoring and Observability

- Application logging with configurable levels
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- Database query monitoring

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless application design
- Database optimization with indexes
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Load balancer support

## Integration Points

- **External Authentication**: Support for LDAP/Active Directory integration
- **Data Import APIs**: Bulk import from HR systems and attendance machines
- **Notification Systems**: Email and SMS gateway integration
- **Reporting Integration**: Export to various formats (Excel, PDF, CSV)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 2.3+
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and logging
- **Testing**: pytest, coverage reporting
