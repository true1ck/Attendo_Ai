## 🆘 Help! Something Went Wrong!

### 😱 "Git not found"
**Fix:** Download Git from https://git-scm.com

### 😱 "Authentication failed"
**Fix:** Use a Personal Access Token instead of password:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate a new token
3. Use your username and the token as password

### 😱 "Repository already exists"
**Fix:** Either:
- Choose a different name for your repository, OR
- Delete the existing repository and create a new one
